// Study (issue #14, SR2_DLAA_ALPHA=taa): the alpha of the 3D image (where the
// 2D background shows through) smoothed over time by a plain temporal
// filter instead of a second DLAA. The alpha is drawn with DLAA's sub-pixel
// jitter; each pixel blends the new value into its own history, found where
// the surface was in the previous image (the DLAA motion vectors) and kept
// within the range of the new 3x3 neighbourhood so it cannot ghost.
