# Game RAM (Sega Rally 2)

PowerPC RAM addresses (big-endian, 32-bit words unless said otherwise) for the
game's race state, found for statistics and achievements (src/runtime/stats.cpp
still holds Star Wars Trilogy's table). "Confirmed" means seen changing in real
runs, not just read in the disassembly. Addresses of code are the original
PowerPC ones (fn_XXXXXXXX in build/gen).

How it was found:

- The game keeps its own debug-display routines and their format strings
  (0xF26F8 `rank=%d/%d`, 0xF29F8 `rankingRank = %d`, 0xF2A2C `goalFlag = %s`,
  0xF2DA8 `lap %2d/%2d`, `sect`, `sectTime`...). The code that prints them
  (0x4C1F8-0x4D760, e.g. fn_0004C560 GAME, fn_0004D19C Section Time) names
  the fields of the structures below.
- F9 snapshots (out/snap/*.ram + .bmp, Sergi's own races): RAM compared with
  what the HUD shows in the picture (position, times, km/h, gear).
- Headless scripted runs (`--headless --no-menu --auto coin@900,start@960,gas
  every 300 from 1500,gas+@4200`, about 180 frames/s, no window) with
  SR2_RAM_DUMPS every 30 frames, diffed in Python. The self-driven car only
  reaches a wall, so the finish was reached through the game's own progress
  code: `SR2_POKE=22CFBC=N` (see "Progress" below) makes the game pass its
  section, checkpoint, lap and goal points itself, with all their normal
  effects (FINISH!!, CLEARED card, next stage, ending, records). Practice:
  `SR2_POKE=22432C=1@960` picks PRACTICE at SELECT GAME.
- One windowed run in the background (LW_BACKGROUND=1, LW_SHOTS=60) of the
  same forced championship, to see what each phase is on screen.

Time units used by the game:

- **frames**: 1/60 s (the clock, lap frame counter).
- **ticks**: 1/6000 s (1/100 of a frame): stage and championship times, lap
  times, records. 137160 ticks = 22.86 s, shown as 00'22"86.
- **HUD BCD**: 0xMSSmmm (minutes, seconds, thousandths as hex digits):
  0x151466 is 1'51"466.

## Main sequence and phase

| Address | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| 0x22D618 | int | Main sequence: 0 attract, 1 game (credit to GAME OVER), -1 power on. Table 0xEDAF0 (known, runtime.cpp) |
| 0x22D624 | int | Phase inside the game (sequence 1), table 0xE911C (12 bytes: init, frame, exit). Confirmed: **1** selects and the races (all stages of a championship), **2** the crowd/podium scene after the last stage of a championship, **3** the replay (championship: replay with the staff credits, TOTAL and per-stage times at the bottom; practice: replay of the race), **4** RANKING table, **5** GAME OVER.

Bit 0x1000 = the per-car table instead. NB its value before any game is 0 too; read it only after phase leaves 1 |
| 0x22D630 | +0x71C | int | **Race result**: 0 before the start, 1 racing, **2 finished (goal)**, **3 time up**. Confirmed |

## HUD values

| Address | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| 0x13AB74 | int | **Position** shown on the HUD, 0 = 1st (15th/16 = 14). Confirmed on 5 snapshot pictures (8th, 9th, 15th...). Live, every frame |
| 0x225A18 | int | Cars in the race (16 championship, 2 practice) |
| 0x13AB7C | int | Seconds left shown (known) |
| 0x13AB80 | int | Gear shown (1-4). Confirmed |
| 0x13AB8C | BCD | **TOTAL TIME** (championship: all stages so far). Confirmed on pictures (0x151466 = 1'51"466 vs 1'51"43 shown a frame earlier) |
| 0x13AB90 | BCD | **LAP TIME** (current lap; -1 between stages) |
| 0x13AB94 | int | Current lap, 0-based (HUD lap marker) |

## Progress, checkpoints, lap and goal

fn_0003F1AC (every frame) reads the player car's track point (car object at
[0x2242B0] + 0x48), adds the signed difference to the last point (+0xA4) into
the progress counter +0xA8 (0x22CFBC). fn_0003EA54 then compares the progress
with the next event points:

- progress >= +0x84 → fn_0003DFDC: next section (+0x9C), split time.
- progress >= +0x88 → fn_0003DEA4: **lap completed** (+0x94 + 1, next lap line + 256).
- progress >= +0x80 → fn_0003E308: **checkpoint** (+0x98 + 1, next checkpoint;
  the clock gets its extension).
- laps completed (+0x94) >= laps (+0x3C) → fn_0003E3D4: **GOAL** (goalFlag = 1,
  stage time added to the totals at +0x168/+0x16C).

Checkpoint extension, confirmed: championship Desert checkpoint 1 added 1800
frames (+30 s) to the time left, counted in one second a frame (the time left
goes up by 59 a frame until the extension is in); practice Desert
+10 s per checkpoint, and crossing the lap line adds time as well. The simplest
detection is the time left (0x22CF88) going **up** while the clock counts
(0x22CF84 == 2); the checkpoint counter 0x22CFAC + 1 is the same event
(lap-line extensions don't move it). DEBUG TIME INFINITE holds the time left
at its maximum, so it hides the jumps; the game is marked cheated then anyway.

## Finish, stage cleared, time up, championship result

Confirmed sequence for each championship stage (forced runs, every 30 frames):

1. Goal frame: 0x22CF90 0→1, 0x22D630 1→2, clock state 3, car status 3,
   laps completed = laps. Screen: FINISH!!
2. About 7 s later: CLEARED <COURSE> STAGE! RANK nn / CLEAR TIME / TOTAL TIME.
   Stages cleared (0x22CFA4) + 1 as the card ends, when the next stage's round
   is already in 0x22CF48 (so the course cleared is the round seen at the
   goal); the stage-clear code compares it with the stage count (0x22CF4C).
3. Next stage: round (0x22CF48) changes (3 → 2 → 5 → 4), goal 0x22CF90 and
   0x22D630 go back to 0, clock state 1, then 2 when it starts.
4. After the last stage (Riviera, 2 laps): CONGRATULATIONS!! card with RANK
   and the four stage times; 0x22D604 = 1; then phase 2 (crowd), 3 (replay with
   credits), 4 (RANKING CHAMPIONSHIP), 5 (GAME OVER), then sequence 0.

So, for achievements:

- **Stage cleared**: 0x22CF90 0→1 while 0x22D618 == 1 and phase 0x22D624 == 1.
  Which stage: 0x22CF48 (round) or 0x22CFA4 (stages cleared before it).
  Classification: 0x22D018 + 1 (or HUD 0x13AB74 + 1, which can differ by one
  right at the line).
- **Time up / game over**: 0x22D630 == 3 (0x22CF90 stays 0). Then rankingRank
  is set to -1 and the phase goes to 5 (GAME OVER), sequence 0 after it.
- **Championship finished**: 0x22D604 0→1 with mode 0 (or stages cleared
  0x22CFA4 reaching 4). Final position = the position at the last goal
  (0x22D018 + 1; the CONGRATULATIONS card showed RANK 15th = 14 in the forced
  run). Final time: 0x22D07C (ticks).
- **Practice finished**: 0x22D604 0→1 with mode 2 (goal 0x22CF90 = 1 on the
  same race); course from the round (seen: 9 Desert, 8 Mountain, 10 Riviera;
  11 Snowy by the table); lap times at 0x22D598. Then phase 3 (replay), 4
  (ranking).
- **Best lap** of a race: min of the lap times 0x22D598 + 4 × i for i < laps
  completed. The game also keeps best-lap record lists in backup RAM
  (0x4B2D20 area; the practice Desert run put its three laps into the list at
  0x4B2D7C, sorted, ahead of the default 1860000-tick entries). Not mapped per
  course.

## Records and the name

fn_0002BD60 puts a finished game into the records (the game's backup RAM
block 0x4B2208..0x4B3D1C, per its own `bkram` debug lines):

- 0x4B2210: CHAMPIONSHIP table, 16 entries of 16 bytes: name (3 letters + 4
  '.' at +0), flags byte at +7, time in ticks at +8, car/transmission byte at
  +0xC. Default entries SAS 10'00"00, POO 10'10"00, MOR... (what the RANKING
  screen and the HUD's STAGE TOP 3 show). Confirmed: the forced 22"86
  championship went in at 1st as "..." (time 0x0217C8 = 137160).
- 0x4B2310 + car × 0x80: 8-entry table per car (rankingRank | 0x1000).
- 0x4B2810, 0x4B2890, 0x4B2910, 0x4B2990: per-stage tables, 8 entries each
  (they changed when the stages were cleared).
- Callers: fn_0004AE60 (championship, at the final result), the stage-clear
  code at 0x2B6A4-0x2B748 (practice, after its race; it also sets 0x22D604 and
  picks phase 3), fn_0002B81C (game over).

**Name entry: not found.** No name-entry screen appeared in the forced runs
even with a 1st place in the championship table; the record was written
with the default name "..." taken from 0x4C271C at race set-up, and nothing
in the code writes the name there at a fixed offset. It may be off in the
game's settings, need an input this script never gave, or belong to the link
(network) entry states (NS_ENTRY_* strings). To detect "the player set a
record" without it: rankingRank 0x22D608 >= 0 read once the phase leaves 1
after a finished game (it is -1 after a time up), or a change in the
0x4B2210 table.

## Operator settings (EEPROM copy) and difficulty

The game keeps the whole 93C46 EEPROM (64 words) in RAM at 0x4A9D00. The
operator's GAME ASSIGNMENTS are one word at **0x4A9D18**:

| Bits (mask) | Field |
|---|---|
| 0x80000000 | ADVERTISE |
| (w >> 26) & 3 | CABINET |
| (w >> 22) & 0xF | LINK TYPE |
| **0x00380000** ((w >> 19) & 7) | **DIFFICULTY**: 0 NORMAL, 1 HARD, 2 VERY HARD, 3 VERY EASY, 4 EASY |
| 0x00040000 | DEFAULT VIEW |
| 0x00002000 | SPEED MPH / KMH |
| 0x00000100 | DISPLAY URL |
| 0x00000020 | GAME MODE |
| 0x00000010 | COCKPIT REACTION |

At each new game (code at 0x2CC2C) the difficulty is copied into 0x22CF18
(game structure +0x04). Race set-up, fn_0004041C, picks with it a row of
the time table (pointer per mode at 0xE8348: championship 0xE58C8, practice
0xE62C8): the start time and then each checkpoint's extension, in frames,
-1 ending the list. Championship rows are 0x80 bytes, one per difficulty in
the game's numbering, with 16 bytes per course id. Only the time limits
change, not the rivals. Seconds (read from the ROM; start, checkpoints):

| Difficulty | Desert | Mountain | Snowy | Riviera |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NORMAL | 50, 30 | 30, 27 | 30, 26 | 38, 34 |
| HARD | 50, **28** | 30, 27 | 30, 26 | 38, 34 |
| VERY HARD | 50, **26** | 30, 27 | 30, 26 | 38, 34 |
| VERY EASY | 50, 30 | **32, 29** | **32, 28** | 38, 34 |
| EASY | 50, 30 | **32**, 27 | **32**, 26 | 38, 34 |

Confirmed in headless runs (`--difficulty X`, checkpoint forced with
`SR2_POKE=22CFBC=110@5000-5001`): 0x22CF18 follows the option (3, 4, 0, 1,
2), the Desert championship starts with 3000 frames (50 s) at every
difficulty, and its first checkpoint adds 1800 frames (30 s) on NORMAL,
EASY and VERY EASY, 1680 (28 s) on HARD and 1560 (26 s) on VERY HARD.

Practice rows (0xE62C8) are 0x30 bytes per course id, 0x180 per difficulty.
Every practice race starts with 60 s; only the **first** extension depends on
the difficulty, and by much more than in the championship. Seconds (start,
then each extension in order):

| Difficulty | Desert | Mountain | Snowy | Riviera |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NORMAL | 60, 20, 20, 30, 20, 30 | 60, 32, 25, 30, 25, 30 | 60, 30, 23, 26, 23, 26 | 60, 30, 30, 30, 30 |
| HARD | 60, **18**, ... | 60, **30**, ... | 60, **28**, ... | 60, **28**, ... |
| VERY HARD | 60, **13**, ... | 60, **25**, ... | 60, **23**, ... | 60, **23**, ... |
| VERY EASY | 60, **35**, ... | 60, **47**, ... | 60, **45**, ... | 60, **45**, ... |
| EASY | 60, **25**, ... | 60, **37**, ... | 60, **35**, ... | 60, **35**, ... |

Confirmed in headless practice runs (`SR2_POKE=22432C=1@960-1100`, checkpoint
forced with `22CFBC=110@5100-5101`): Desert starts with 3600 frames at every
difficulty and its first checkpoint adds 2100 / 1500 / 1200 / 1080 / 780
frames (35 / 25 / 20 / 18 / 13 s) on VERY EASY / EASY / NORMAL / HARD /
VERY HARD.

The DIFFICULTY option (OPTIONS > GAME, `--difficulty`) rewrites these three
bits of the RAM copy every frame when they differ (runtime.cpp); the EEPROM
itself (save/eeprom.bin) keeps the operator's setting.

## Other fields seen (not needed so far)
